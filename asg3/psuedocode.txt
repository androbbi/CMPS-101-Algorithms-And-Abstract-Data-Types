If sizes aren't the same throw an error
Create a new matrix
Copy Matrix you're passing in into a new matrix incase the matrices are the same
If we have two matrices that are teh same, we do scalar multiplication
for each element in the array //for loop
  each element in the array
  if the copied list is empty 
  if it's zero move to the zeroth index
  move to head of row for copied matrix
  create new list
  append each entry to the new list
add list to new matrix
change the number of nonzero entries in the matrix
if the copied matrix's length is 0 move to the head of the list and create a new list
append each entry in the list to the new list
after that change the number of nonzero entries in the new matrix
create pointers to the heads of the list (copied matrix and this matrix)
for each element in the list if we get off the end of the list, we break
off the list of A add the value of B to the new matrix
off list B add the value of A to the new matrix
if you're not off the end of one of the lists
we get the entries in each list
if the matrix's 1 column is > matrix's 2 column then we add the entry in matrix 2 to the new matrix
if matrix 2's column is > matrix's 1 column add the entry in matrix 1, otherwise the columns must be the same
add the value of the entries together and add them to the new matix



























Subtract:
create 2 new matrices
multiply m by negative one
then call add
return whatever is returned from add
